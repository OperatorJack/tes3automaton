# tes3automaton

A CLI tool for automating some repetitive modding actions in TES III: Morrowind. Although intended to be used for Morrowind, some features can be used more generally.

## Commands

### batch-img

Allows batch conversion of images between Morrowind image formats and PNG format. This can be used to easily convert large number of textures between DDS, BMP, TGA, and PNG formats. Some potential uses include updating your mods textures to all use DDS format, changing compression levels, or converting textures to PNG to use with AI upscalers.

Use `tes3automaton batch-img --help` for more information.
